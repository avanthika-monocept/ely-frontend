  "annual performance bonus for my band": `Hi Navodit,
I understand that you are looking for information regarding the annual performance bonus for your band (4A). Let me provide you with the details based on the company's policies.
Eligibility for Annual Performance Bonus:
Employees who are not on the sales incentive scheme.
Must have joined Max Life on or before 31st December of the Financial Year.
Must have a G3 rating or above in the annual appraisal cycle.
Employee must be active and not serving notice period at the time of payout.
Bonus Calculation Guidelines:
Bonus is calculated as a percentage of the prorated Total Fixed Pay (TFP) of the performance year.
Basis the G score, the applicable bonus percentage is multiplied with the TFP (prorated for the number of days worked in the performance year).
Bonus will be deducted for employees on Leave Without Pay (LWP) for more than 30 days.
Women employees on Half Day Half Pay will receive 50% bonus for the number of days on Half Day Half Pay.
Employees transferred from Sales Incentive role to Annual Performance Bonus role will be eligible for bonus prorated for the number of days worked in the Annual Performance Bonus role.
In case of band change (i.e., promotion from Band 5 to Band 4, Band 4 to Band 3, Band 3 to Band 2, and so on) post 31st December of the financial year, bonus will be calculated on TFP and bonus percentage as applicable for the Band as on 31st December.
Payout Grid at 100% MoS Achievement:
Rating Scale Outstanding (G1) Exceeding Expectation (G2) Meets Expectation (G3) Needs Improvement (G4) Fails to Meet Expectation (G5)
Band/Score 1-1.5 1.51-2.5 2.51-3.5 3.51-4.5 >4.5
Band 4 16%-20% 13%-15.97% 11%-12.98% 0% 0%
Example Calculation: If your Total Fixed Pay (TFP) is INR 10,00,000 and your G score is 2.35 (G2), the bonus percentage as per the grid would be 13.45%. The bonus calculation would be as follows:
[ Bonus = TFP × (182/365) × 13.45% ]
[ Bonus = 10,00,000 × 0.4986 × 0.1345 = INR 67,066/- ]
